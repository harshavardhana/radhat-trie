This is an implementation of the HAT-trie data structure described in,
 
    Askitis, N., & Sinha, R. (2007). HAT-trie: a cache-conscious trie-based data
    structure for strings. Proceedings of the thirtieth Australasian conference on
    Computer science-Volume 62 (pp. 97â€“105). Australian Computer Society, Inc.
 
The HAT-trie is in essence a hybrid data structure, combining tries and hash
tables in a clever way to try to get the best of both worlds.
